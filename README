This program adds one layer of Bourne/POSIX shell escaping around every
argument passed to it (each argument is escaped individually, to preserve the
boundary between arguments).

Specifically, it prints a single quote before each argument, then prints all
characters of the argument verbatim, except for single quotes, for which it
prints a single quote, a backslash, and two more single quotes. Then it prints
a final single quote and a space (to separate the arguments from each other).
To make the output more legible when used interactively, it prints a trailing
newline instead of a space after the last argument. Since Bourne/POSIX shells
strip off ALL trailing newlines when doing command substitution, it won't in
practice effect the usecases where this tool is needed.
